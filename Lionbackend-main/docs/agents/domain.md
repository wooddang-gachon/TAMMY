# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT-MAP.md`** at the repo root — it points to one `CONTEXT.md` per context (`AiServer` and `backendServer`). Read the one relevant to the task.
- **`docs/adr/`** — read system-wide ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in, as well as any module-scoped ADRs (`AiServer/docs/adr/`, `backendServer/docs/adr/`).

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill (reached via `/grill-with-docs` and `/improve-codebase-architecture`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

Multi-context repo:

```text
/
├── CONTEXT-MAP.md
├── docs/
│   ├── adr/                         ← system-wide architectural decisions
│   └── agents/                      ← agent configuration and skill metadata
├── AiServer/
│   ├── CONTEXT.md                   ← AiServer domain concepts & glossary
│   └── docs/adr/                    ← AiServer-specific decisions
└── backendServer/
    ├── CONTEXT.md                   ← backendServer domain concepts
    └── docs/adr/                    ← backendServer-specific decisions
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in the relevant `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal — either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (decision title) — but worth reopening because…_
